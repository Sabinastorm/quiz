## Testing

### Browser testing

Website has been tested in Google chrome and Safari

Website has been testen on Apple Iphone

Both test confirmed that the website works great

All the functions and responsiveness do not work on Apple iPhone

### Validators

The website has been through W3C Jigsaw validation with no errors.

Website has been through W3C HTML Validator and there is no error to report

### Local testing

Testing of all the buttons shows no errors

### Responsiveness

I used Google Chrome Dev Tools to check the responsiveness of website. The website is not compatible with Apple iPhone for now.

## Version control

### Git and Github

I used GitPod as a local repository and GitHub as a remote repository. The process of version control was:

- First i created a new repository in GitHub
- Then opened that repository in GitPod and started coding
- In GitPod i created my files and folders
- I then saved my work and pushed it to GitHub repository to keep it safe

Saving, commiting and pushing it to remote repository in terminal:
- git add . 
- git commit -m "Commit message" 
- git push to update work to GitHub

## Deployment

To deploy the website, I followed the below steps on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

- Go to "Settings" on the repository
- On "Source" of "GitHub Pages", select "master for Branch and click save
- Refresh page
- The website is now published on GitHub Pages and the link is provided on on the same section
